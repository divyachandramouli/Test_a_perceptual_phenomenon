# Test a perceptual phenomenon 

This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Term 2.

The goal of this project is to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect.
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.


## Outline of analysis

* Identified the components of the experiment, and used descriptive statistics to describe the qualities of the sample
* Created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task and set up a hypothesis test
* Built visualizations to show the distribution of sample data
* Used Python to perform the statistical test and reported results
* Made inferences and drew conclusions based on the result
